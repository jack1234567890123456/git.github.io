<h1>What happened on D Day</h1>
<p>Airborne troops were dropped behind enemy lines in the early hours, while thousands
of ships gathered off the Normandy coast for the main attack.
Though they were expecting an invasion, German military leaders believed the initial attacks were only a diversionaryshortly after midnight, three US and British airborne divisions, more than 23,000 men, took off to secure the flanks of the beaches. Myriad naval vessels and landing craft gathered at a location in the Channel dubbed "Piccadilly Circus.</p>

<h1>How many troops took part?</h1>
<p>Up to 7,000 ships and landing craft were involved, delivering a total of 156,000 men and 10,000 vehicles to the five beaches along the carefully selected stretch of the Normandy coast.
The landings would not have been possible without the support of massive air and naval forces, which were much stronger than the Germans'.
But on D-Day alone, as many as 4,400 troops died from the combined allied forces. Some 9,000 were wounded or missing.
Total German casualties on the day are not known, but are estimated as being between 4,000 and 9,000 men.
Thousands of French civilians also perished, mainly as a result of bombing raids carried out by allied forces.Throughout the day troops landed on the beaches. By midnight, the Allies had secured their beachheads and pushed further inland from Gold, Juno, S
word and Utah.</p>
